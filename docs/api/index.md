# QUnit API Documentation

QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit test suite. If you're new to QUnit or even just new to unit testing, you might want to check out the [Introduction to JavaScript Unit Testing](http://qunitjs.com/intro/). There's also a [QUnit Cookbook](http://qunitjs.com/cookbook/) on the [main site](http://qunitjs.com/).

To get started, use the search at the top of the page, view the [full listing of entries](/category/all/), or browse by category from the sidebar.

QUnit has no dependencies and works in all browsers.
